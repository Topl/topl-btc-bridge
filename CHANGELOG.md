## [Unreleased] - 2023-mm-dd (this date should be changed on release)

### Added

- Minting status is now displayed in the UI.
- Dependency on `akka-slf4j`.
- New parameters for the launcher:  `--btc-url`, `--btc-port`, `--btc-user`, `--btc-password`, `--zmq-url`, `--zmq-port`. These allow to connect to the Bitcoin node and the ZMQ server.
- Support for monitoring the Bitcoin network.
- Support for monitoring the Topl network.
- Logging all command line arguments when starting the application.
- Support for sad path: User did not send the funds.
- Support for sad path: Bridge did not mint the tokens in time.
- Support for sad path: User did not redeem the tokens in time.
- Add new parameter `--topl-blocks-to-recover` to specify the number of blocks to wait for the Topl network to recover.
- Add two new fields to the `StartPeginSessionResponse` message: `minHeight` and `maxHeight`.
This is needed to know the range of blocks to wait for the redemption.

- No longer hardcodes the user's public key. User can provide it during session creation
- Session creation also displays the escrow script for the user
- Rename `--blocks-to-recover` to `--btc-blocks-to-recover`.
- Update the contract for the redemption to include the height. The new contract
`threshold(1, sha256($sha256) and height($min, $max))`.

### Removed

- `/api/confirm-deposit-btc` WS was removed.
- `/api/confirm-redemption` WS was removed.
- Removed the signature from the contract for the redemption.
- Removed the bridge public key from the `MintingStatusResponse`, as it is not
needed anymore.
